Real-Time Traffic Analysis and Prediction Using IoT and Big Data

This project  to apply IoT, real-time data processing, and predictive analytics to address urban traffic challenges.

Overview about it :

1. Data Collection:
   - Identify appropriate IoT sensors and data sources, such as traffic cameras, GPS trackers, and vehicle detectors, that can provide real-time traffic data.
   - Explore government open data portals, transportation department websites, and collaborate with universities or research institutions to access relevant datasets( Player performane ) .
   - Ensure compliance with data licensing agreements and obtain necessary permissions for accessing and using the data ethically and legally.

2. Data Ingestion and Streaming:
   - Using Apache Kafka to set up a real-time data streaming pipeline to ingest the collected traffic data.
   
3. Real-Time Data Processing and Analysis :
   - Using Apache Spark Streaming to consume the real-time traffic data from Kafka.
   - Analyze the real-time traffic patterns, detect congestion, and identify trends and anomalies.
  
4. Visualization and Dashboards:
   - Incorporate features that allow users to explore historical trends, compare traffic patterns, and generate custom reports.

5. Deployment and Scalability:
   - Ensure the system can handle high-volume, real-time data streams and provide low-latency responses.
   - Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to track system performance and notify stakeholders of critical events.
